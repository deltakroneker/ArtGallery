Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with three shades of yellow ‘and nothing else’. In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence.", date: "2009-06-15T13:45:30", physicalMedium: "Canvas", principalMaker: "Van Gogh", makerLine: "Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), Arles, January 1889", webImageURLString: "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Bawo7r1nPZV6sJ4OHZJHdKV_4Ky59vquAR7KoUXcNZgx9fqTaOW-QaOM9qoyYhOTAopzjt9OIfW06RMwa-9eJW9KjQw=s0", localImageData: nil)
